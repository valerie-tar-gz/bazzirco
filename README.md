# Bazzirco
This is a quick and dirty image which combines the best of [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) and [Zirconium](https://zirconium.gay/).

Deck images exist, and do work, but they're a WIP due to a lack of controller navigability.

To install, install Bazzite (preferably the GNOME image, KDE does work though), and rebase with one of these commands. Nvidia images are GTX 16XX or newer.

AMD/Intel image:
```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/bazzirco/bazzirco
```

Nvidia image:
```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/bazzirco/bazzirco
```
